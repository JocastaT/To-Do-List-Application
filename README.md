# To-Do-List-Application
To Do List - Hybrid Web Application using Ionic Framework, Angular, Aparche Cordova, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Database using Google Firebase Cloud Firestore, on Visual Studio Code. 

## Description
The mobile application I created is a Task Manager Application called “Todo.txt”. This application allows users like students to keep in track of their daily tasks they need to do and be able to remind them and organise better. Moreover, it would help them have better time management for their given assignments. This application is created mainly for the younger generations and working adults to be able to keep track of their responsibilities, hence making it a habit for them to better manage their daily responsibilities.
